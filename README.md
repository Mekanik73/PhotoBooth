PhotoBooth is a prototype that allows people to take pictures from their Rasberry Pi camera with the push of a button. The idea came to me as I was looking to get deeper into the Rasberry Pi camera. Camera + LED + Push button naturally leads one to make a photobooth right? 
 
## What's the purpose of this project? 

The purpose of this project is a personal research one, a dive into the world of Rasberry Pi and Python. Why put it on GitHub? I love to show people what I'm learning!

## How does it work? 

The way it works is that after setting up the circuit and code. As shown below...

You press the button on the breadboard

The LED lights up

You have 5 seconds to take a picture! Saved to your desktop! Don't forget to smile!

Everyone thinks it's *too* simple until they need a family picture (:  

## What languages and hardware were used?

Rasberry Pi B+, Rasberry Pi Camera, Push-button, LED, Python (GPIO package) 

## What could be improved 

The number one thing to add, is to get the user *to choose where the picture is being stored*, right now the Photobooth doesn't allow that. 

I'm definitely going to work towards building a **computer vision** component, one that can detect faces.

I could also opt to send pictures **automatically to facebook messenger, so they can send themselves the pictures**. This woold make the PhotoBooth tool user-friendly and 
teach me more about **APIs**.  

*Voice* Could be phenomenal help because if you're taking a picture you want your hands free. Adding "Shoot" as a command could trigger picture. This would also introduce 
me to **NLP (Natural Language Processing)** which I would totally love to learn. 

A **GUI** could definitely make user experience much better. 

In terms of hardware, I can add more button functionality. Clicking once will snap a picture, clicking 3 times sets up a series of shots, and holding down the button can 
open up the messenger tab to send pictures.

**I'll try working on maybe one of these in the coming months**

## What did you learn?  

As with any project a lot

**Software**

* Python (GPIO package for RasPi)
* Python (picamera package)	
* Raspian OS (Debian-based)

**Hardware**

* Rasberry Pi B+ interface 
* Rasberry Pi GPIO (Using the pin system) 
* Properly using push-buttons
* Understanding pull-up and pull-down resistance 

**General**
* Reading complex guides and code documentation (the ability to identify and answer your own questions, an underrated skill)
